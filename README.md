# Sorting Visualizer
Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I wanted to visualize sorting algorithms in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here: https://yassinezn.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/

## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Bubble Sort Algorithm**: is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

**Selection Sort**: is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort

**Insertion Sort**: is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time

**Merge Sort**:  is an efficient, stable sorting algorith that makes use of the divide and conquer strategy!
